**IMPORTANT NEWS**

Autosplitter works with all versions of Saints Row The Third Remastered, including:

- Good Old Games,
- Epic Games Store,
- Steam,
- Splitter automatically switches, recognizes versions to work with.

I have added more resolutions:

- 1080p,
- 1050p (New),
- 1024p (New),
- 900p,
- 800p (New),
- 768p,
- 720p,
- 480p (New).

Big thanks for ASL script examples.

Important notice! If I'll know any different version of the game I'm going to update the code automatically without notice. I think this is not going to happen because we use game exe and that file looks like never changes and I have already found all the versions. Reminder I think gog version of the game is the least stable. It can crash after Pierce's Guardian Angel. Certain characters brake the game and it will unable to load assets after Stop All The Downloading so you end up stuck in air as you turn to start deckers.die.

Known bugs:
- [ ] It can split on loading after restart[^1].

- [ ] Split depends on resolution[^2].

[^1]: *False split.*
[^2]: *There is a memory address to mitigate this dependency.*
