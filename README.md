Autosplitter works with all versions of Saints Row The Third Remastered, including:

- Good Old Games,
- Epic Games Store,
- Steam.

I have added more resolutions:

- 1080p,
- 1050p (New),
- 1024p (New),
- 900p,
- 800p (New),
- 768p,
- 720p,
- 480p (New).

Splitter automatically switches versions to work with.

Big thanks for ASL script examples.

Known bugs:
- [ ] It can split on loading after restart.

- [ ] Split depends on resolution[^1].

[^1]: *With better coding knowledge there is a better address to mitigate this dependency.*
