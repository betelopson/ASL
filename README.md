**IMPORTANT NEWS**
 <hr>
 
Autosplitter works with all versions of Saints Row The Third Remastered, including:

- Good Old Games,
- Epic Games Store,
- Steam,
- Splitter automatically switches, recognizes versions to work with.

I have added more resolutions:

- 1080p,
- 1050p (New),
- 1024p (New),
- 900p,
- 800p (New),
- 768p,
- 720p,
- 480p (New).

Big thanks for ASL script examples.

Important notice! If I'll know any different version of the game I'm going to update the code automatically without notice. I think this is not going to happen because we use game exe and that file looks like never changes and I have already found all the versions. Also a little reminder I think gog version of the game is the least stable, it can crash after Pierce's Guardian Angel or if you choice certain characters close to the end the game is going to be unable to load assets in Stop All The Downloading.

Known bugs:
- [ ] It can split on loading after restart[^1].

- [ ] Split depends on resolution[^2].

[^1]: *False split.*
[^2]: *There is a memory address to mitigate this dependency.*
